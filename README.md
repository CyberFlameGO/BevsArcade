### Why I stopped
Bad return on investment because support costs kept growing.

### Review
* this program made $1000 - $2000, it had a 5/5 star reviews and a bunch of happy customers
* what I would have done different is...
  * go into a market which has an older age range, as the average customer 
was 15-18 they were very protective of their money
  * Make more youtube videos to promte the program via content marketing
